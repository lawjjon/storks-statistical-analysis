# storks-statistical-analysis

This project analyses data from the paper *Robert Matthews. “Storks Deliver Babies (p = 0.008)”. Teaching Statistics. Volume 22, Number 2, Summer 2000, p36-8*. The paper presents a highly statistically significant correlation between stork populations and human birth rates across Europe. It is often used to demonstrate the dangers in confusing correlation with causation. 

Here, the data is used to compare the performance of different regression models in modelling the number of births and the number of storks.

#### Techniques used:

- Regression modelling
- Confidence intervals
- Bootstrap (resampling method)
- Root mean squared error
